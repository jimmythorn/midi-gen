# MODES
# Ionian: This is the standard Major scale (e.g., C Major, D Major, etc.). It's a bright, happy sound.
# Dorian: A minor scale with a major 6th (e.g., D Dorian, E Dorian, etc.). Itâ€™s often used in jazz and blues, giving a minor but slightly optimistic sound.
# Phrygian: A minor scale with a lowered 2nd (e.g., E Phrygian, F Phrygian, etc.). This gives a darker, exotic flavor.
# Lydian: A major scale with a raised 4th (e.g., F Lydian, G Lydian, etc.). This has a dreamy, bright sound.
# Mixolydian: A major scale with a lowered 7th (e.g., G Mixolydian, A Mixolydian, etc.). It has a bluesy or rock feel.
# Aeolian: The Natural Minor scale (e.g., A Minor, B Minor, etc.). It gives a more somber or melancholic sound.
# Locrian: A minor scale with a lowered 2nd and 5th (e.g., B Locrian, C Locrian, etc.). This scale is often avoided due to its unstable sound.
